# Machine-Learning-Classification-Tasks

A Classification Algorithm is a procedure for selecting a class from a set of alternatives that best fits a set of observations. An example would be predicting whether a customer would buy a certain product or not making use of the various shopping habits of the customers or assigning a diagnosis of a disease to a given patient as described by observed characteristics of the patient(gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).

This repository covers my humble analysis of datasets using various Classification algorithms with varying complexities. Tha analysis is performed in R as well as Python using Ipython Notebooks(.ipynb files). A working knowledge of R and Python is required to read through the scripts. 

Here's a list of notebooks illustrating some of my current projects:


1.  [Occupancy Detection Using Classification Methods using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Classification-Tasks/blob/master/Occupancydetector.ipynb)

2.  [Magic Gamma Telescope : Predicting Signal Or Background](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Regression-Methods/blob/master/Energyefficiency.ipynb)
