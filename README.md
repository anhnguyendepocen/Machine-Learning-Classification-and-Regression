# Machine-Learning-Classification-Tasks

A Classification Algorithm is a procedure for selecting a class from a set of alternatives that best fits a set of observations. An example would be assigning a given email into "spam" or "non-spam" classes making use of various features of the email or assigning a diagnosis to a given patient as described by observed characteristics of the patient(gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).
