# Machine-Learning-Classification-Tasks

A Classification Algorithm is a procedure for selecting a class from a set of alternatives that best fits a set of observations. An example would be predicting whether a customer would buy a certain product or not making use of the various shopping habits of the customers or assigning a diagnosis of a disease to a given patient as described by observed characteristics of the patient(gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).
